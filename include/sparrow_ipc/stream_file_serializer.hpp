     * @brief A class for serializing Apache Arrow record batches to the IPC file format.
     *
     * The stream_file_serializer class provides functionality to serialize single or multiple 
     * record batches into the Arrow IPC file format suitable for storage. It ensures schema 
     * consistency across multiple record batches and optimizes memory allocation by 
     * pre-calculating required buffer sizes.
     *
     * @details The stream_file_serializer follows the Arrow IPC file format specification:
     * - File header magic bytes (ARROW1 + padding)
     * - Stream format data (schema + record batches + end-of-stream marker)
     * - Footer (FlatBuffer containing schema and empty record batch blocks)
     * - Footer size (int32)
     * - Trailing magic bytes (ARROW1)
     *
     * The class validates that all record batches have consistent schemas and throws
     * std::invalid_argument if inconsistencies are detected.
     *
     * @note Unlike the stream serializer, the file serializer automatically writes the
     *       complete file format (including header and footer) when end() is called or
     *       when the destructor is invoked.
